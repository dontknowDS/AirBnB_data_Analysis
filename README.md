# AirBnB_data_Analysis
## Installation

The Natural Language Toolkit nltk, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and statsmodels is necessary to run the code. 
There should be no further necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

In this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. The dependency between price and season
2. How well can we predict prices and what are the big contributing factors
3. The dependency between review comment's sentiment and season



## File Descriptions 

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](
