    "    1. The dependency between price and season\n",
    "    2. How well can we predict prices and what are the big contributing factors\n",
    "    3. The dependency between review comment's sentiment and season \n",

    "For answering these questions, we will use data from calendar, reviews and listings databases.\n",
