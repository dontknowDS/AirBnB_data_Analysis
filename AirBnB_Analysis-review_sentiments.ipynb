I met her when I arrived and they showed me everything that I asked for. I forgot a towel and she supplied me one.   I did not arrive until the evening  and went to bed early and woke up early, so I did not have much contact with them. The neighborhood is a very quite.  I slept very well.  I will stay here again when I come back for another workshop.  \n",

Close to beach, shopping, main street with restaurants. The only thing little uncomfortable ( and if the weather is cold) is that the bathroom/shower is outside the room, one has to go out through the patio to the main house. \n",

She left us a nice note even though she was out of town when we arrived. The listing was accurate. The room was just the right size for the two of us. The neighborhood was quiet and very close to California Ave, which had plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and stores. \n",

They went out of their way to make me feel at home.  Their home is as described; you can see Lake Washington from your room and walk on a path alongside it.  On a sunny day, I was able to see both Mt Rainier in one direction and Mt Adams in another!!  Even their cat was especially friendly.  \n",

Our week was activity-packed with many scheduled events to attend and had family members scattered around Ravenna, so we weren't around much to spend quiet times at the suite. On the check-in day, we went straight to a museum after picking up my sister from the airport and then headed to a dinner gathering from the museum. So we checked-in late, I'd say ~ 11 pm.  Though we had the entry code, Tom stayed up to greet us at the door and to show us around. The place is cute, as you see in the photos; a packed linen closet and bathroom full of accessories.    BTW, there's a local fruit/vegetable stand at the corner intersection and a Whole Foods Market a few blocks down which came in very handy for quick breakfast needs.  His place is ornate; reminded me of New England homes with character! I'd recommend this suite to anyone, especially with a 'little munchkin' (who can sleep inside the small Nintendo room).  \n",

We walked everywhere. We were able to eat dinner and go out right by the apartment, and three people using the space to sleep didn't feel too crowded. Morgan was flexible with my check-in time and very quick to respond. One of the rules about the use of the building through Airbnb felt a little aggressive, but I'd consider staying here again on my next trip to Seattle! \n",

And surprisingly secluded and private too. Exactly what we needed after a day of busy city seeing. Never got to meet Dirk and Jaq, but they were on top of informing us about how to get the key and such. I would totally stay there again. Be aware though, if you are a light sleeper, leave the window shut, the bus depot is conveniently close, and early morning squeaky breaks were not how I wanted to wake up.  \n",

The tea and ground coffee etc available for guests was a great additional touch, especially after the nearby coffee shop is closed.  Expect a bit of exercise climbing into the bed, and bringing any luggage up the front stairway.\n",

The space is exactly as shown in the photos. The location couldn't have been better—it's within walking distance to the Pioneer Sq and many cool shops & eateries. Both mornings I walked to a nearby coffee shop recommended by the hosts and enjoyed great coffee with my breakfast. The Union Station and the Amtrack Stations are literally 5 mins walk away. There are actually 2 bathrooms (one with shower, one without) so I never have to wait for the washroom. If I were to pick something negative, I'd say the floor in the unit is concrete and there is no central heat. It can quite cold in the winter but the space heater was enough for me. Also, I hear people coming in & out throughout the night, although I hear them only when I fall in & out of sleep. The place is very quiet the other time.\n",

The room had the amenities that were described, but I think it was not fully prepared due to PJ's issues getting back into town.  Specifically, there were wet towels scrunched up in the bathroom and while I found eggs in the frig, that was the only breakfast option available (no breakfast beverages).  The bedding and extra sleeping arrangements were in the room, and there were clean towels provided to us with the bedding.  I did not get a good idea of the neighborhood; I got in late and left early.  \n",

PJ was a great host! The apartment is a little smaller than I thought but it is plenty of space for one person. It is in an area close to all the sights in Seattle. The laundry is on the same floor and cost $1.50 per wash/dry.  \n",

I was out in Seattle for most of the days so I didn't spend too much time in the room. The small kitchen served my purposes and the bathroom was well supplied. The place was clean and I didn't have any issues. \n",
       "2359    This was a nice place, matched the listing and was very clean. It is quite small but it has everything you need (microwave, bathroom, etc).  My only issue was with the wifi. I specifically chose a place with wifi as I had to check in with work while I was out of the office in Seattle. If I didn't need wifi, I may have chosen a different place. The network name wasn't included on the sheet with the password, and it took the host 9 hours to get back to me as to which network it was. Then, the password didn't work. So finally, seven hours after that, the host came to the apartment, and upon seeing the info sheet, said that the wrong password was on the info sheet. So overall, I ended up having to use phone data (which was costly because I was in a different country) for most of my stay because they put insufficient/incorrect information on the sheet. Again, this is not a big deal if you don't need wifi, but I specifically chose a place with that amenity and for one amenity not to be included because of human error (and to cost me extra cash) was not really up to standards for me. Otherwise, it was a nice place, clean, and close to downtown.\n",

Owner is very generous with kitchen and bathroom necessities. However, bedroom floors were dirty... Dusty and lots of hair.. and bathroom would've been better if it were cleaner. The iffiest part was we weren't sure if our sheets were washed prior to our arrival as there were strands of hair underneath the duvet and pillow shams and the bed sheet was wrinkled as if someone had just slept on it. Was going to reach out to the owner/host, but we didn't really see them and we were only there for 2 nights. Not the nicest area of Seattle, as we were also told by local lyft and uber drivers, but very close to airport and downtown. \n",

They left treats and snack out and had a very friendly cat that we enjoyed napping with. We missed paths on the way in but met up on the way out and lo and behold we knew each other from high school! We had a great time sipping coffee and catching up and will definitely check back in for future Seattle trips.\n",

The house is clean and sunny in a nice neighborhood. \\r\\nI will definitely stay at The Corner Room again the next time I visit.\\r\\n\n",
       "104    This was my first experience with AirBnB, and I have to admit I was a little nervous. But, Bonnie was a delight and made me feel comfortable and very much at home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to arriving in Seattle, Bonnie was extremely attentive to my emails and answered all of my questions immediately. We quickly establish great lines of communication which made me feel very much at ease. \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arrival, she was very flexible with our check-in time and greeted my boys and I at our car.  Once in the home, she was very thorough with her tour, and left us with a welcome letter, and details to some important responsibilities.  I felt very comfortable chatting with her and felt that she and I could very easily hit it off as friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was obvious that Bonnie spent a lot of time thinking of ways to make us feel at home. Age appropriate toys were left out for my boys, a bowl of fruit was filled for us to enjoy, beautiful accents of fresh flowers and plants filled the space, and a wonderful selection of LP's were at our finger tips, just to name a few. The place was every bit as beautiful and inviting as the photos, and the energy of the home was so relaxing. \\r\\n\\r\\nBonnie's attentive and thoughtful hospitality has set a high bar. I hope that other hosts are just as welcoming as she was.  She and her Urban Tree-house will be first on our list for our next trip up to the PNW.  \n",

Bonnie was very responsive and had suggestions of things to do in Seattle over a holiday weekend. The space was cozy, and it was a very welcoming space for a family with children. There is a great coffee shop across the street, as well as a park within walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed at the apartment during a Seattle heat-wave, so the older building ended up being a little stuffy without A/C. Fans and open windows helped during the nights.\n",

Although we were on the go 90% of our trip, they were eager and willing to provide us with amazing suggestions, travel tips and even took time out to research bus information for us. The little things that can make city traveling a little tricky, were a breeze thanks to their assistance and advice.  Their home is conveniently located near a bus stop that makes it easy to get to and from the city, and neighborhood is close to the beach, and in a quiet safe setting.  We also had the need for street parking and found a close by spot for our van/trailer rig everyday when we returned. \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir kids made the stay especially enjoyable and fun. They are full of energy and life, but they were also very respectful of our space and we never felt like our privacy was compromised. The bedroom where we stayed was downstairs providing us a quiet nook to rest in after our long city days. Hamlin and Amy even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy while we were there and made us feel like friends, not just passing through! \\r\\n\\r\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay with the Ham Fam again! \n",

He was extremely pleasant during our meeting and was more than kind and considerate when showing us the apartment. Detailed instructions were left which made it very easy to make ourselves at home for the time spent in Seattle.\n",

When I asked if he had a coffee grinder and he didn't have one, he bought one and a coffee press for my use.  He got bagels, OJ, and cream cheese, too!  \\r\\nThe location is just a 10 minute walk to the public market and downtown.   You can uber to Space Needle for minimal fare. Just right.\\r\\nYou can't go wrong with this place.\n",

The apartment was even better than described and we really appreciated the bagels and OJ. Perfectly clean apartment, comfortable bed and plenty of space for 2 people. Using the big screen to watch netflix was an awesome bonus too! Although it's a 15/20 minute hilly walk to the centre of Seattle, this didn't matter as the apartment was so nice.\n",

Comfiest bed and air mattress for extra guests, wonderful sauna, and beautiful environment. West Seattle is a really fun mix of city and beach town. There's also an easy bus to catch down town, but coming back to such a relaxing part of the city was a huge comfort. Jessica was also so sweet and responsive to all my questions. Overall really great place to stay! I would definitely want to come back.\n",

Crashed there just for the night with my mom and sister on our day trip to Seattle from Portland. Never met Jessica but she provided everything we needed and the place was easy to find. Sauna was nice after a long day walking around town. \n",

I would definitely go back there again and would recommend the place to others.\n",

We only saw Jessica the day we got there as she's pretty busy, but we did get to hang out with her for cats which were all sweet and friendly. The neighborhood was great, and it was close to Seattle Centre, which was what we needed.\\r\\nRoom and house were clean and having the outside deck set was nice. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. Unfortunately we didn't make use off the sauna, so I can't comment.\n",

The space is very comfortable. There's an outside area to sit and have coffee or hang out. It's separate from the main house, so you have access to the kitchen and bathroom through a side door right next to the Zen Den. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is awesome - just a quick walk to the water or to The Junction (this area of town). Great restaurants and funky boutiques. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had our dog with us this trip and found both her house and the neighborhood very dog friendly. Lots of places to walk your dog. It's a 15 minute drive to one of the best dog parks I've been to (Westcrest).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were visiting friends and family closer into downtown Seattle and the drive was quick and easy every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside was worrying about walking into her house to use the bathroom or grab some water in the middle of the night - which is pretty typical for me in general....\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn't see her much, but whenever we ran into her, she was very welcoming. I totally recommend her space!\n",

The setup is perfect and sophisticated. It is a very short walk from the bus that will take you downtown (the C) and it's near little shops and cafes. We only met briefly but Jessica is a wonderful host and you're always greeted by at least one cat anytime you are coming or going. :)\n",

The room is a little smaller than it appears in the photo, but it's still sizable and the bed is actually bigger than it appears, and a good bed is really all anyone needs! Her laundry machine was broken, which isn't a big deal in of itself, but considering we were coming to the close of a 3 week road trip and she knew of our situation, it would have been nice to know of this ahead of time since it was inevitable we'd want to use it. Of course that's minor, and overall we had a great stay! It's a great room with a great zen feeling and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to relax! \n",

Didn't get to meet Jessica while we were there, but she replied to messages quickly and was very helpful when we had trouble with the internet connection. Would definitely stay again.\n",

The place is very calm and close to Seattle Downtown, which you can reach in 25 minutes through the Gilman-Burke trail by bike. I felt home and i could enjoy my privacy as some very good conversations as well. I was the first guest, and i could only recommend it to anyone.\n",

I've had yet another amazing experience. Jennifer is such a caring and thoughtful host in addition to being a talented creative/designer.  I got in later than expected my first night and she never made me feel as if I was imposing. She had numerous treats for me waiting and was always responsive/proactive for any questions/directions etc.  Her space is even larger and more cozy than I expected. Huge bathroom, skylight, peaceful, quiet. She's done a perfect renovation leaving no stone unturned in my opinion.  The tree-lined neighborhood is quiet, convenient to all of Seattle, close to bike trails, shopping, and also easy access to Bellevue/Kirkland.  Parking was easy and the whole experience was awesome.  I only wish I had had more time here. Although I did have time for a late night walk to Metropolitan Market for their famous chocolate chip cookie! ll be keeping in touch with Jennifer and would highly recommend staying here for the beautiful space and the good energy she brings to the experience. Thanks so much Jennifer!\n",

It was decorated beautifully, bright & light, and comfortable! There was an Apple TV I made good use of, a useful assortment of dishes, a coffee maker, and snacks, and the bathroom was large and updated! The neighborhood was beautiful, safe, and there was a lovely grocery store within walking distance. I'd honestly love to come back to stay here! :)\n",

Carla and Seamus were away.  The house was in a part of Seattle I hadn't been in and reminded me so much of Portland.  The park and ferry were literally across the street, which allowed for walking after dinner.  Sean was polite, congenial, and a fount of information.  We slept well.  And on Sean's advice we ate quite well too.  Had the best cup of coffee from their kitchen.  We will be back.\n",

The house was in a safe, perfect location and was impeccably clean. Karla managed to get our room ready early by ten am which was amazing. They made us feel very much at home and it was just a great place to stay. I highly recommend a stay here if you enjoy a friendly family with a beautiful home. We would love to stay here again when we visit seattle in the future!\n",

I have never stayed in a cleaner home (including mine!). We ended up coming in a day early, and although they were full, they made us up a room in the den. It was perfect.

Sean is great,Seamus his son is over the top cute and the house is lovely.  We didn't get to meet Karla she was at work. The house is conveniently  located near the airport right near the water in a cute area. Really great space! The room itself is like staying in a hotel suite. Also very thoughtful amenities are provided\\r\\nas well as breakfast. Way ,way beyond my expectations. Great watching Sean interact with Seamus too. I have already recommended it to friends.\n",

Their place is huuuge! And the location is great. You can take a walk at Lincoln Park, which is right across the street, or drive down to Alki Beach. (Thank you for the recommendation ;) ). Downtown Seattle is only 10 minutes away. If you are not willing to pay a fortune for parking, just take the bus. (again, thank you:) ). Bus stop is only 100 yards away from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis place is THE place to stay in Seattle. It's huge and clean and conveniently located. Not to mention how nice Sean and his family are. I cannot stress this enough!! \n",

It was such an easy check-in and check-out too. Wish we could have stayed longer!\n",

The house was beautiful and our room was perfect. Everything was clean and our hosts were personable and nice. Seamus was a polite delight and even showed us spin moves off the stairs. We travelled with our 6 month old boy and we were asked if we had a bed for him and they even set up a diaper pail for us in our room. I loved staying here and would highly recommend staying with Sean and family to anyone. They definitely made our first airbnb experience a perfect one. \n",

He is very accommodating and kind.  His place is in a quiet, nice neighborhood, and is easy to find.  His home is very nice and I felt comfortable and safe.  The room I stayed in has a window AC as an option, which was utilized.  The bed has the softest sheets.  The bathroom is right next door to the bedroom.  Sean gave us recommendations of things to do in Seattle as well.  I would definitely return to Sean's place whenever we're in Seattle again.\n",
